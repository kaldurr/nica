    <h1>Happy Valentine's Day!</h1>
    <div class="message">
      <p>My Dearest, Nica</p>
      <p>I couldn't imagine spending the last year of my life with a better person but u, you really do complete me my love. I would prefer to celebrate this day with u, but this is where our circumstances lead us;however disappointment,sorrow,sadness, and regret are far from the things that I'm feeling. In one sentence, all I am is happy and grateful to be with u and to be able to make my experience a better one because of u.</p>
      <p>Here's to our first year together, and to many more, My Apricity</p>
      <p>Sincerely, Jolo</p>
